#### Disclaimer: Everything listed here is my own personal experience. Others may, and probably do, have differing opinions. I usually pull a few from this list because others will become apparent throughout the interview. Hopefully this helps someone else catch red flags before they make a major life change.

### How long has the CISO been is his/her position?

This gives me an idea of what level of "this is how we've always done it" I'll be walking into. If the CISO has been there for 10+ years you are almost certainly walking into a static environment.

### Where does the CISO fall in the leadership hierarchy?

This tells me how committed to security the company is or isn't. Does the CISO report to the board or the CEO? Awesome! Is the CISO a VP buried 3 levels below the CEO? Good luck getting anything done. You're probably walking into a "security as a checklist / keeping up appearances" environment.

### Within which organization (Risk, IT, its own Security org, etc.) does security lie?

This helps me understand the level of maturity of their security org as well was what kind of internal politics in waking into. If security reports through IT I know I am walking into a culture with an archaic understanding of security OR a shitload of internal politics that drove that dumbass reporting structure.

### Who would I report to?

This is not necessarily a question for the interview, but something I use to look up the person after the interview. Their experience, or lack thereof, tells me how much vertical babysitting I'll be doing.

### Where do security directives come from? (Bottom-up or Top-down)?

This will give me an idea of how involved senior leadership is in security. In other words, am I fighting an uphill battle or not? Likewise, is this a "rule by committee" org?

### If you had to describe security projects & initiatives, would you describe them as structed and proactive or ad hoc and reactive? Alternatively, is a formal project management methodology applied to security projects and initiatives, or is are they conducted as BAU?

This tells me how organized and structed security is at the company. Am I going to be a hamster in a wheel dealing with ADHD leadership, or does leadership have a crystal clear idea of where we're at and where we're going? This is the difference between drowning in scope creep or getting shit done.

### When is the last time your Information Security Program Charter was reviewed or updated?

This tells me if their security program is formally structured or if it is a loose grouping of teams with little formal linkage.

### What is the average tenure of someone on the team?

If they can't keep people on the team then you might want to look elsewhere.
How static is the role? (i.e., is my role going to change over time, either mildly or drastically?)

Do these people know what they are doing? Is there a plan? Or is this place utter chaos constantly reacting to change?

### How different is the day-to-day and real nature of the work compared to the job description?

Did they simply recycle an old job description because they need someone NOW or did they put in the minimum effort to accurately represent the job. I have been on too many interviews where it was the former.


## difficult questions to ask
### what does your security stack look like
### what are your current security challenges?
### do you have any succcess stores?
### is there any room for growth in the organization?
